# Terraform AWS GraphDB Module

This Terraform module allows you to provision an AWS GraphDB cluster within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in AWS. The module provides a flexible way to configure the cluster and the associated VPC components.

—
## Prerequisites

Before you begin using this Terraform module, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- **Terraform Installed**: You should have Terraform installed on your local machine. You can download Terraform from the [official website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).

- **AWS Credentials**: Ensure that you have AWS credentials configured on your machine. You can configure AWS access keys and secret keys using the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/).

- **Terraform AWS Provider Configuration**: Configure the AWS provider in your Terraform project. You can add your AWS access and secret keys as environment variables or use other methods for provider configuration.

- **Terraform Configuration File**: Create a new Terraform configuration file in your project, and use this module by specifying its source.

## Usage

To use this module, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/Ontotext-AD/terraform-aws-graphdb.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the module directory:

   ```shell
   cd terraform-aws-graphdb/modules/aws-graphdb-cluster
   ```

3. Create a new Terraform configuration in your project, and use this module by specifying its source:

   ```hcl
   module "graphdb_cluster" {
     source = "../../modules/aws-graphdb-cluster"

     # Define your configuration variables here, such as cluster size, VPC settings, and other parameters.


   }

   # Configure the required variables for the module.
   ```




4. Initialize your Terraform workspace and apply the changes:

  ```shell
    terraform init
    terraform plan
  ```

5. Review and confirm the changes when prompted and apply if everything is okay.

  ```shell
    terraform apply
  ```





## Configuration

### Important Variables (Inputs)

The following are the important variables you should configure when using this module:

- `vpc_id`: The ID of the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) where you want to create the AWS GraphDB cluster. This is a required variable.

- `instance_type`: The instance type for the GDB cluster nodes. This should match your performance and cost requirements.

- `cluster_size`: The number of instances in the cluster. Recommended is 3, 5 or 7 in order to have consensus according to the RAFT algorithm. 

- `subnet_ids`: A list of subnet IDs in your VPC to place the Neptune instances. Ensure that these subnets have proper route tables and security groups configured.

- `security_group_ids`: A list of security group IDs to associate with the instances for network security.

### Example Configuration

Here's an example of how to configure the module in your Terraform project:

```hcl
variable "aws_region" {
  description = "AWS region to deploy resources into"
  type        = string
  default     = "us-east-1"
}


variable "azs" {
  description = "Availability zones to use in AWS region"
  type        = list(string)
  default = [	"us-east-1a",
    			"us-east-1b",
  			"us-east-1c", ]
}


variable "resource_name_prefix" {
  description = "Prefix for resource names"
  type        = string
}


variable "graphdb_license_path" {
  description = “Path to your license file” 
  type        = string
  default 	   = "$PATH/$TO/Your/License.license"


}


variable "tags" {
  description = "Common tags for all resources"
  type        = map(string)
  default     = {}
}


variable "ami_id" {
  description = "AMI id"
  type        = string
  default     = null
}
#from Module VM
variable "instance_type" {
  description = "EC2 instance type"
  type        = string
  default     = null
}


variable "graphdb_version" {
  description = "GraphDB version"
  type        = string
  default     = null
}
```

Ensure that you adjust the values of the variables to match your specific requirements.

## Modules

#### [Backup](backup.md)
This Terraform module creates an Amazon S3 bucket for storing backups.

#### [Config](config.MD)
This Terraform module creates AWS Systems Manager (SSM) parameters for managing sensitive data and configuration settings used by GraphDB in an AWS environment.

#### [DNS](dns.MD)
This Terraform module creates a private hosted zone in Amazon Route 53 for DNS resolution in your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).

#### [IAM](IAM.MD)
This Terraform module creates an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role and an instance profile that can be used for EC2 instances. It also supports the option to set a permissions boundary on the IAM role. 

#### [Load Balancer](load_balancer.md)
